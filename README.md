# Browser-Storage-based-Contact-Form
The Form saves entries on the browser's storage and modify them.<br>
The script begins by checking on whether the page is fully loaded or not, then saves entries on the local storage.<br>
When the [init] function is triggered, it will add new or modify content of the newly created session. <br>
Once the entried are submitted, the [stored] class will display latest updated values or change them later on. <br>
There are a few comments in the file to make it easier for others to understand the code. <br>
The Code implementation can be found on CodePen.io [https://codepen.io/abbbas_alhashimi/pen/PopOqmG]
